# Hand Gesture Recognition

Hand Gesture Recognition is a project aimed at developing a system capable of accurately detecting and recognizing hand gestures in real-time. Hand gestures serve as a powerful form of non-verbal communication and can be utilized to control a wide range of applications and devices. This project leverages computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze video input from a webcam and identify specific hand gestures.
